# 📝 To-Do List

This is a simple To-Do list app I built as part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/). It’s far from polished, but it helped me practice **modular JavaScript**, **DOM manipulation**, and **handling application state** in the browser.

## 🌱 What I Learned

- How to **structure JavaScript projects** using modules and separate logic from DOM code
- Managing **dynamic DOM updates** based on user input
- Working with **modals and forms** for task/project creation
- Implementing **custom validation** and user feedback
- Creating and managing a **multi-project structure**, including task persistence across views

## 🔧 Features (currently implemented)

- ➕ Add tasks with title, description, due date, and priority
- 📝 Edit and delete existing tasks
- ✅ Mark tasks as completed (moves them to a "Completed" view)
- 🗂️ Create and delete custom project folders
- 📦 Each task belongs to a specific project
- 📆 View tasks by project in a dynamic UI
- 📁 Everything handled in memory (no backend or storage yet)

## 💡 Notes

- The UI still needs improvement and polish
- No persistent storage (e.g. `localStorage`) — refreshing the page resets all data
- No animations or accessibility features yet
- Todos cannot yet be moved to other projects

## ⚙️ Technologies Used

- Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+)
- HTML5
- CSS3
